This assignment will help you become more familiar with using the STL
containers and especially the algorithms. You will also get some practice
implementing function objects. You are given an interface to a class called
Statistics, which is simply an object that represents a set of integers 
(samples from a random distribution). Here is the list of the public methods to 
implement:

2 constructors - implemented

stream insertion and extraction operators - implemented. Make sure you
    understand how ostream_iterator and back_inserter are used

basic statistics functionality:
   Average()   - sum of all values divided by the size of data
   Size()      - size of the data
   Minimum()   - obvious
   Maximum()   - obvious
   Deviation() - standard deviation is a measure of how much the data is 
                 dispersed from the average. 
                 formula Deviation( x_1, ... , x_n ) = sqrt ( 1/n * sum ( x_i -a )^2 )
                 Where 'a' is the Average.
                 Basically deviation is an average of the squares of the distances to the average.

More interesting stuff:
    OccuresMoreThan - returns values than occur more then the given multiplicity.
                      Make sure your implementation is O( N logN ) run-time complexity.
                      Function returns std::map<int,int>, where first int is the value 
                      from the data and second is it's multiplicity.
    RemoveIf        - removes values that satisfy a given condition. May be used to delete
                      noise from the data.
    Histogram       - data structure representing data by splitting the range of data into 
                      smaller intervals (bins) and counting samples for each of the bins.
                      For example data: 1 1 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 5
                      split the range into intervals: [1,3), [3,5), [5,7)
                      count values                     5      4      1 
                      Note - traditionally the bins are half open intervals.
                      The type of the return value is std::vector<int> - the vector of counts.
                      Arguments - number of bins, beginning of the range, and of the range,
                      for example for the above example Histogram( 3, 1, 7 );
    DrawHistogramH  - draws histogram horizontally in ASCII. The above histogram will be 
                      |*****
                      |****
                      |*
                      Note: '|'s are not part of the output and represents the 'bottom' of the graph.
                      Arguments - same as Histogram.
    DrawHistogramV  - EXTRA CREDIT.
                      draws histogram vertically in ASCII. The above histogram will be
                      *
                      **
                      **
                      **
                      ***
                      ---
                      Note: '-'s are not part of the output and represents the 'bottom' of the graph
                      Arguments - same as Histogram.
                      
you are to leverage the STL to do most of the work. The challenge is that you
are not to use any looping constructs in your code. This means no for, while,
do, recursion, or anything else. (Recursion is a form of iteration.) You
will need to use the STL provided algorithms that iterate over the
containers (e.g. for_each). Study the driver to see examples of using for_each.

Notes: 
    - implement template methods in the header (outside of the class declaration)
    - make sure functions that do not modify data are const.
    - Average may be implemented using std::accumulate.
    - Deviation may be neatly implemented using the second overload of std::accumulate that
      allows 4th argument.
    - DrawHistogramH may benefit from using std::setfill and std::setw
    - DrawHistogramV may be implemented using a dirty trick, say you need to iterate 1 to N,
        but for-loops are prohibited, use
        std::vector<int> v(N);
        std::generate( v,begin(), v.end(), NextInt() );
        std::for_each( v,begin(), v.end(), DoWork() );
    - if you are having trouble implementing using functors and for_each, try to implement
      first using for-loop and then convert it to for_each.
